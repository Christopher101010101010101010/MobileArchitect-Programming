# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    This mobile application was designed to assist users in tracking key events such as doctor appointments, social events, medication schedlues, etc. To achieve these goals user can 
    add event object titles, date/times and descriptions. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
#    To achieve the goals of this system, there was a need for a primary login window, new account window, event tracker window, update event window and sms messaging permission window.
#    The features necessary to perform the functionality of the system were a user account database, an events database, and sms messaging permission within the application manifest.
#    These UI designs were implemented with users in mind as layouts were kept simple and direct prompting users when necessary and including action objects at the top of the screen 
#    to ensure ease of use.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
#    When developing this mobile application I began by determining the proper UX layouts to ensure that all required interfaces were introduced at the locations, after designing the app
#    screens I progressed toward the back-end programming for individual screen functionalities, and finally worked to connect the application screens in a synchronuous fashion. In future
#    assignments I will likely follow a similar strategy by determining the screen layouts of the project application before developing the back-end software necessary for the software package's
#    operation.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
#    When testing my software I utilized manual trial runs to test various inputs and behaviors directly, though battery assertion testing could've provely equally valuable. The testing
#    process is important since it reveals many weaknesses in seemingly sound software, in this program it revealed issues in passing context between activity classes proving that this application
#    will crash occasionally when switching between activities/window layouts.


# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
#    There were instances inwhich this project found resistance from passing intent objects, context references, and database members; to overcome these complications
#    I reviewed multiple examples, forum posts, and course book sections to determine how to develop the strongest code possible to ensure consistent application performance.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
#    I was particularly satisfied with the UX for the login and new account creation windows since context is consistently passed between these activities without
#    confusion, the user account database remains static even upon closing the application, and the screen layouts are intuitive as well as simplistic.
